Mailman's setup works as mentioned in /mailman/docs/START.rst, however
if we try to run ipython by changing mailman.cfg (use_ipython: yes) venv does
not recognise the default ipython at /usr/bin/ipython3 which explains some issue
with $PATH variable in venv. If we build outside the venv in mailman folder 
$ python3.4 setup.py develop, it may install everything but while running mailman
```
â€º mailman start
Starting Mailman's master runner
/usr/bin/python3.4: can't open file '/usr/bin/master': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

```
this might come as a problem. As a hack we can activate venv and start mailman
and then deactivate and check `mailman status` which will be `running`, now we
can use ipython as our prompt for commands.
