# Third Party Applications


### Windows users:
* Download your phone's USB drivers from its site. (In my case Samsung).
* [Download Samsung Drivers][1] (for Windows 32 or 64bit, depending on what you are using).
* The rooting app needs [Dot Net Framework Version 4][2] to work.
    
## Procedure

* Step 1
   -- Make sure USB Debugging is on (Settings > Applications > Development > USB Debugging).
* Step 2
   -- Download [GalaxyS_I9000_One-Click_Root][3]. (My phone, but this will work for majority of the phone with Froyo and Eclair )
* Step 3
   -- Next, connect your phone to the computer an start the file you downloaded in step 2.
* Step 4
   -- Now click One Click Root 2.1 or 2.2 and follow the programs instructions. Please note that for One-click root 2.1, your phone needs to be running Android 2.1 Eclair and for One-click Root 2.2, Android 2.2 Froyo.
* Step 5
   -- If you are planning to unroot yo Samsung Galaxy S i9000, follow all the steps, and in Step 4 and click one click unroot.



### Congratulations, you now own a rooted phone.
**NOTE** : This tool roots both Android 2.1 Eclair and Android 2.2 Froyo and offers one click unroot/root option.

### Just one more step :
_Download_ : [Proxydroid][4]  -- via Computer
OR
Use GPRS to download the same from Android Market.

Fill in the required settings. (Very easy)
Enjoy running all the applications. (If still runs slow, check for your wifi network server load.)
